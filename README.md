<h2>Court Case Jedgement Summarizer</h2>
Judgments in cases from the Indian framework are often lengthy, voluminous, and factually informative, making
them cumbersome and time-consuming to dissect and interpret correctly. To overcome these barriers, this paper
proposes two novel methods. The first method centers on creating an accurate, factually informative summary
that is specifically tailored for attorneys, thereby improving their ability to readily extract information pertinent to
a case. The second solution tried to make it clearer and more concise than the previous one so that the envisioned
friendlier approach would translate into more extensive use for legal information. Our methodology assumes a
strong approach in using extractive summarization through the BERT Classifier model, which understood the
context and, therefore, extracted the details efficiently. More fundamentally, we enhanced this model by adding
a user-friendly feature intended for the general public-by allowing a user to input a YouTube link. With this
implementation, it transcribed the video transcript and provided an abstractive summary, thereby providing an
elaborated, readable interpretation of the information. This innovation goes beyond making legal documents
more accessible but contributes to more informed legal literacy and accelerates the decision-making process.
